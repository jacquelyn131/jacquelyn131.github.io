            <p id="faq-paragraph">Jacquelyn Shelby is a self taught artist who learned while she was studying abroad in
                China. She learned from how-to-draw books from different bookstores which were mostly by Japanese or
                Korean artists. That's how the books told her to draw eyes so that's how she learned to draw eyes when
                she was first learning. ^_^
